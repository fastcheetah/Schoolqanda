Building after exams 


> _"Helping students succeed—one question at a time."_ 💙
Need to find content and questions for the page

Backend Structure 
What do I want for now with the backend of this project
I want users to sign up and login but I dont want a simple sign up and log in I want the user to reach to a point then they have to sign up or log in
I want like the medium interface when where the user isnt a premium user they cant read the full text something like that
Yes I know about past papers and exam questions and will work on that when Im done with the backend because its part of the research so it can be later on why I also havent built the content for topics page also design and layout
Whats on my mind right now before working on the backend would be to reduce how the grid of the topics of the bio page looks as screen size reduces probably have to make it look the way it is until we reach a small screen size

I seriously dont know how Id even begin to get into this backend but gotta hop into it and if anyone reads this one day I have exams this week so wish me luck and Grace to lock in.
Might ask for advice from others on how they get into backend
Backend is PHP and MySQL and other techstacks along the way I might need i guess.

Replanning the project
NEXT THING TO DO 
Build an authentication system with php and mysql and this might take some time but not much hopefully

It took me so long to fix my sql problem 
mysql_error.log 2025-07-22 0:55:45 0 [ERROR] Can't start server: Bind on TCP/IP port. 
I was skeptical about changing the port which took some time but I had to.
Steps
Open Xampp then MySql gui then config then open the ini file then look for port
Then highlight it and hit ctrl + h and change all port 3306 to 3307 then go back to xampp then on top right side of xampp and click config then services then click sql and change port to 3307
